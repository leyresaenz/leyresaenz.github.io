I am a motivated student of Economics, with a strong vocation for social transformation and a special interest in human development,
poverty, education and economic growth. I believe in the multidisciplinary approach to solve different problems. I have had the enormous opportunity to live for several years in different countries around the world, which has made it easier for me to be prepared to quickly adapt to very diverse contexts, allowing me to develop an open-mindedness that characterizes me.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Economics in 2021 at [Universidad de San Andrés](www.udesa.edu.ar) (thesis pending).  
Current student in master's degree in Economics at [Universidad de San Andrés](www.udesa.edu.ar).  

My interests in the area of Economy are in poverty, social and human development (development economics), public policy, demography, economic growth, inequality and education. 

My general interests / hobbies are painting and drawing, reading (especially things about philosophy, spirituality, psychology and human knowledge), writing, meditation, training and trekking (I am an active person who really enjoys being surrounded by nature).
