In December, 2021, I obtained my B.A. in Economics at Universidad de San Andrés. 
Currently, I am a Master’s Candidate in Economics, also at Universidad de San Andrés.
Always highly motivated, I have a strong call for social causes and a deep interest in human development, poverty, education, and economic growth. I also believe in a multidisciplinary approach as the best way to solve challenging problems. 
As regards my personal life, I have had the opportunity to live in different countries around the world. Over the years, this has proven to be a crucial thing in my journey – time and time again, when faced against a diverse or changing scenario, it has always been easier for me to quickly adapt and respond to them. These perspectives, in turn, have also contributed to my open-mindedness, which I am grateful to have and eager to continue developing.

My interests in Economics are in poverty, social and human development (development economics), public policy, demography, economic growth, inequality and education. 

My general interests / hobbies are painting and drawing, reading (especially things about philosophy, spirituality, psychology and human knowledge), writing, meditation, training and trekking (I am an active person who really enjoys being surrounded by nature).
